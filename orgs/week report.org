#+Author: Wuhao Wei

* Work done:


** Cameras
press v to switch cameras

*** auto follow camera

*** controllable follow camera
  operation instructions:
   1. use > or < key to change the dist between the spider and the camera
   2. use w/a/s/d to rotate

*** world camera
There are two kinds of world cameras.
1. First one is just operating the cameras. 
2. Second one is cast a ray from the camera to gameobjects.
The difference is the rotating operations:
1. the first one rotates the camera itself
2. the second one rotates the camera around the ray hit point. 
Cons&pros:
1. The first one is hard to operate.
2. The second one is easy to operate. Besides, I could shoot food or bombs towards the hit point. However, the ray must hit at least one objects. And one problem here is how to deal with the condition that the ray hit nothing(need some suggestion here).
operation instructions:
1. 1,2,3,4 to reset the camera position and orientation
2. w/s/a/d to rotate
3. > or < to change the dist between hit point and camera
4. arrow keys to change the position of the camera
