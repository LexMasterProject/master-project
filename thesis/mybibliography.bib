@article{keyframe4,
abstract = {We present an integrated system that enables the capture and synthesis of 3D motions of small scale dynamic creatures, typically insects and arachnids, in order to drive computer generated models. The system consists of a number of stages, initially, the acquisition of a multi-view calibration scene and synchronised video footage of a subject performing some action is carried out. A user guided labelling process, that can be semi-automated using tracking techniques and a 3D point generating algorithm, then enables a full metric calibration and captures the motions of specific points on the subject. The 3D motions extracted, which often come from a limited number of frames of the original footage, are then extended to generate potentially infinitely long, characteristic motion sequences for multiple similar subjects. Finally a novel path following algorithm is used to find optimal path along with coherent motion for synthetic subjects.},

@article{arsimu7,
abstract = {We describe a system for dynamically animating the locomotive behaviour of arthropods (insects, spiders and numerous other species) in real-time, facilitating realistic and autonomous traversal across an arbitrary environment. By combining a decentralised reactive behavioural model with a hybrid approach to motion that utilises the comparative advantages of physical simulation and kinematic control, our system is capable of automatically generating complex organic motion over a wide range of surface features, independent of structural complexity. The reactive embodiment of the creature, combined with the physical simulation of the virtual world enables the formation of emergent behaviours that are entirely based on circumstance, including rigid-body interaction, grip recovery and adaptive wall climbing.
